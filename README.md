# Hash Table vs. Linked List
This project measures the performance of linked list and hash table for the same input in terms of speed. While hash table's search operation costs O(1), linked list's search operation cost is O(n). So, you can easily observe their run times using large and intense inputs. Please, read the report clearly before using the code.
